    <p>Freshly baked focaccia is the foundation of many things, including one of the greatest sandwiches I've ever made!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>825 g bread flour</li>
        <li>150 g whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>830 g water</li>
        <li>7 g instant yeast</li>
        <li>150 g mature sourdough stater</li>

        <li>30 g extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>za'atar</li>
        <li>flaky salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl of a stand mixer, combine bread flour and whole wheat flour. </li>
        <li>To the side, mix warm water (100F) with instant yeast. Mix thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Using a dough hook attachment, mix on low speed while mixing in the yeasty water. Mix for 10 minutes. Scrape down the sides occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add fine sea salt and switch to medium-low speed and mix for an additional 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>While mixing add in extra virgin olive oil and mix for an additional 3-5 minutes. </li>
        <li>Dump dough out onto a non floured work surface. Knead using the slap and fold method for about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a 3-4qt container, generously spray with oil along with a drizzle of olive oil. Toss the dough and cover with a greased lid. </li>
        <li>Place into the fridge for 48-72 hours. </li>
        <li>Grab a pan and spritz with spray oil along with a glug of olive oil. Carefully remove the dough onto the baking sheet. </li>
        <li>Gently stretch the dough to the edges. Cover with an inverted baking sheet, wrap in plastic wrap and let rest for 3 hours.  </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500-550F. </li>
        <li>Using olive oil and any desired toppings, drizzle the top with oil and top with whatever spices or fillings desired. Zaâ€™atar and flaky salt used in the video.</li>
